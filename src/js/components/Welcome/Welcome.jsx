          Feel free to call me <strong>Evo</strong> for short. I am a San Diego native who enjoys coding! 
          I have been in tech for about <strong>{codingYears} years</strong> hands on and 
          <strong> {professionalYears} years</strong> professionally, along with several years of experience as an automotive mechanic. 
          You can check out some projects below, or click on the link to find out more about my journey. 
          A little bit of context on my site â€” I created it using React and GraphQL to pull in my projects and history. 
          CSS needs some polishing.
